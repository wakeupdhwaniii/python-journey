# Random Forest

## What it is
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

## What I learned
- Bagging (bootstrap sampling)
- Random feature selection
- Majority voting
- Why Random Forest generalizes better than a single decision tree
