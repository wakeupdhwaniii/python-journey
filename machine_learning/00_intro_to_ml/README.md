# Introduction to Machine Learning

## What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a field of computer science where models learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for every rule.

Instead of writing fixed logic, we train models using data.

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning
- Data has **input features (X)** and **labels (y)**
- Model learns a mapping from X → y

**Examples:**
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

**Typical use cases:**
- Price prediction
- Spam detection
- Pass / fail prediction

---

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
- Data has **no labels**
- Model discovers hidden patterns or structure

**Examples:**
- K-Means Clustering
- PCA

**Typical use cases:**
- Customer segmentation
- Pattern discovery
- Data compression

## Basic Machine Learning Workflow

1. Understand the problem
2. Collect and explore data
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Choose a model
5. Train the model (`fit`)
6. Evaluate performance
7. Improve / tune the model

## Important Concepts

### Features and Labels
- **Features (X):** input variables
- **Labels (y):** output or target values

---

### Training vs Testing
- **Training data:** used to learn patterns
- **Testing data:** used to evaluate generalization

---

### Overfitting vs Underfitting
- **Overfitting:** model learns noise, performs poorly on new data
- **Underfitting:** model is too simple to capture patterns

## Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
