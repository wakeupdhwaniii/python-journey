# Python Journey 🚀

This repository documents my Python learning journey with practice exercises and mini projects, focused on data analysis and ML foundations.

## Structure
- `basics/` — core Python basics
- `data_structures/` — lists, dicts, sets, tuples
- `pandas/` — pandas practice
- `mini_projects/` — small end-to-end projects

## How I work
- Each topic has practice files with examples + small exercises.
- Mini projects are in their own folders with a short README.
