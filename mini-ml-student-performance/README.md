# Mini ML Project: Student Performance Prediction

## Objective
To analyze student data and predict whether a student passes or fails using multiple machine learning models.

## Dataset
Features used:
- Age
- Department (CS / EE)
- Marks

Target:
- Passed (True / False)

## ML Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

## Steps Followed
1. Data creation and inspection
2. Feature engineering (Pass/Fail)
3. One-hot encoding of categorical data
4. Train-test split
5. Model training
6. Model evaluation and comparison

## Key Learnings
- Logistic Regression works well for linear patterns
- Decision Trees capture non-linear patterns but may overfit
- Random Forest improves generalization by combining multiple trees

## Result
Random Forest performed best among the three models due to reduced variance and better generalization.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
